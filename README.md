Why Roommate Finder
-------------
Other apps help you find an available room in your area, but only one app helps you find the perfect roommate: Roommate Finder! Roommate Finder uses a series of personality questions to match you not only with a room in your area, but also with a perfect roommate. Simply fill out a quick questionaire and your feed will be populated with people looking for a roommate just like you!
